Gusts relent through raindrops' downfall
Winter's storm settles heavy over all
All the kids rush indoors for a movie
This is not the right weather for smoothies
Nor should the children watch Better Call Saul
The rain thunders on, and cell phones are silenced
Watching Shrek I, with all the mouths tensed 
The perfect rainy day activity
